# More Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains additional functions and exercises focused on
nested loops in C programming. The goal is to practice and reinforce
the understanding of function creation and control structures.

## Files

- `0-isupper.c`: Function to check for uppercase characters.
- `0-main.c`: Test file for the `_isupper` function.

## Usage

To compile and run the tests for the functions in this directory, use:

```sh
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isuper
./0-isuper
